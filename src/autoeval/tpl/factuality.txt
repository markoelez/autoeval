You are evaluating the factuality of an AI model's response.

The model was asked:
<prompt>
{{ input }}
</prompt>

The model responded:
<response>
{{ output }}
</response>

The model was expected to output:
<expectation>
{{ expected }}
</expectation>

Your response should be a JSON object with the following fields:
1. score: a floating point number between 0 and 1 indicating how well the model performed
2. reasoning: 1-2 sentences describing your reasoning

The factuality of the response relative to what was expected is the only criteria you should evaluate. Nothing else matters.
Reply only with your assessment.
